### The Reflective Rule Language ###

This module includes a parser and examples for the _Reflective Rule Language_, a
DSL used to ensure the consistency of data stored on the Reflective Platform.

### In action ###

```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:iteration2/reflective-lang-rules.git
cd reflective-lang-rules
npm install
npm test
```

### Examples ###

The examples are found in the `examples` folder, where each `.pattern` file
defines a set of rules expressed using the _Reflective Rule Language_. The
corresponding ASTs generated by the parser can be found in the `generated`
folder.

Feel free to experiment with the language by changing some of the definitions, or
create an example of your own. Running `grunt` from the command line will clean
out the `generated` folder and reparse everything found under `examples`.
